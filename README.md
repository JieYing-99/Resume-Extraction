<h4 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h4>

The extraction of employees’ credentials from resumes and data entry have always been
tedious and time-consuming, especially when the number of resumes to be processed for a job
opening is way higher than the number of people assigned to process them (Anaswara &
Aswathy 2019, p. 661). The manual way of extracting and entering the employee’s credentials
is not only inefficient, but also prone to human errors. 
Therefore, this project aims to minimize human efforts in information extraction and data entry.
